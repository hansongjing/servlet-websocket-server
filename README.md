# HTML Chat using Java Servlets, tomcat 7 and WebSockets

Very simple chat that uses webSockets. On a server side we have tomcat, servlets and MySQL. JavaScript (JQuery) on a client side.
Chat's super skill is to changes links that are sended through. Simple links are surrounded with \<a href\> and link to pictures with \<img src\>

P.S. Chat was written just for me. To increase my knowledge and programming skills.
